# Master data

Wrapper functions documented in the "Master data" section are designed to abstract away the details of the smaller functions, such that the most common use-cases of the package can be executed in succinct code.

We begin by extracting all tables as simple features.
```{r}
#data_dir <- "M:\\Users\\uqfcho\\Documents\\seq-koala-monitoring\\working_data"
data_dir <- "C:\\Users\\uqfcho\\Documents/seq-koala-monitoring/working_data"
fcn_set_home_dir(data_dir)
fcn_set_grid_size(100)
master <- fcn_all_tables_sf()
```

The extracted "master" dataframe contains spatial representations of the transects in both linestring formats (single observer line transects from the newer 2020-current database) as well as other spatial representations (strip/ UAoA transects, and some line transects from 1996-2015). The `fcn_mixed_extract_raster` function handles these mixed formats simultaneously. It wraps around functions that use linear referencing approaches to extract grid information from rasters, as well as raster extraction tools, with `exactextractr` that uses C++ as a backend for quick extraction.

The function `fcn_all_transect_grid_fractions` abstracts away from that. In one function call, the algorithm executes the following:

1. Generate spatial grid

2. SQL queries to extract transect-level data

3. Joining with spatial features (if needed) or generate spatial features by coordinates

4. Buffer spatial features (if needed)

5. Calculate grid weight fractions - iterating through all buffer values by buffering each polygon and extracting its weights

6. Collating all results into a list format

```{r}
transect_grid <- fcn_all_transect_grid_fractions(buffer = c(0, 2500))
```
The end result is a list containing tables of line transects, strip transect, and all of area transects. The tables are in long format, so each row corresponds to one grid cell that has an overlap with the transect. Each transect is identified uniquely by its TransectID.

Particularly the Line Transect, Strip Transect and UAoA tables contain the "GridID" and "fraction" column that contains the Grid cell that it overlaps with, and the "fraction" columns showing the fraction which the transect overlaps with. Depending on the buffer, the "fraction" is different; here we illustrate a no-buffer (0) and 2.5km (2500) buffer, in the columns 'fraction_0' and 'fraction_2500' respectively.

```{r}
glimpse(transect_grid)
